  "There are several debt repayment strategies available.",
  "Prioritizing High-Interest Debts:",
  "Debts with a higher interest rate generally cost you more money in the long run than debts with lower interest rates, even if the amount of principal you owe (your balance before adding any interest) is the same. Prioritizing high-interest debts is considered the most effective debt management strategy.",
  "If you decide to follow the higher interest rate strategy...",
  "- List your debts by interest rate from highest to lowest.", "- Keep paying at least the minimum amount owed on all of them, but focus any extra money you can spare on the debt with the highest interest rate.", "- After you've paid off that balance, tackle the one with the next highest interest rate, then the next, until you've taken care of all of the debts on your plate.",
  "Minimum Payments/Debt Snowball:",
  "According to this strategy, you always continue making all minimum monthly payments, but rather than organizing debts by their interest rates, you focus your extra money on eliminating the smallest balance first. Once you've paid off that one, take the amount of money you were paying each month and apply it toward the next-smallest balance, along with the minimum payments you were already making on that account.",
  "Once the second debt is gone, you once again take all of the money you were paying each month and put it toward the next-smallest debt, continuing onward through all of the debts you owe, building momentum like a snowball rolling downhill.",
  "Loan Consolidation:",
  "Loan consolidation is the process of combining multiple loans into a single loan. By doing so, borrowers simplify their debt management and make one monthly payment instead of multiple payments to different lenders. The purpose of loan consolidation is to streamline repayment, potentially secure a lower interest rate, and improve overall financial management.",
  "Credit Counseling:",
  "Credit counseling is a service provided by nonprofit organizations to assist individuals in managing their debts and improving their overall financial situation. Credit counseling agencies offer guidance, education, and support to individuals who are struggling with debt or facing financial challenges."
